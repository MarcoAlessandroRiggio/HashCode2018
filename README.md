Code for Google HashCode contest.

Hash Code is a team programming competition organized by Google for students and industry professionals across Europe, 
the Middle East and Africa. You pick your team and programming language, we pick a Google engineering problem for you to solve. 

The [track](/resources/online_qualification_round_2018.pdf) explain the problem.
In [resources](/resources)you can also find the official dataSet.
In [src](/src) yuo can find an idea of "solution".

Everything is based roundabout theOranAlgorithm: the most amazing algorithm I've seen.
I can't explain what it does, it's too much for me, maybe one day [Pub](https://github.com/OranBar) (I usually call him Pub)
he'll decide to explain it, we will discover it only by living. 


The code present in this repo is wrote in team, each contributor is equaly owner.
